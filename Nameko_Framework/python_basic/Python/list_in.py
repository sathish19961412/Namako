#List in Python
import this

#List in Changeable
#The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
#Allow Duplicates
#Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
thislist=["sathish","guru","prasath","guru","sathish"]
